# EFQL - A generic data querying library that builds on top of Entity Framework Core
How to build a generic data querying library (efql) on top of Entity Framework Core, with similar functionality to GraphQL (including nested field/collection selection and nested field filtering), but without implementing a GraphQL backend.

(Work in progress, soon will be adding the tutorial content and the accompanying code, for both the library and usage examples)

## 1. Exploring the generic data querying library (efql) we will be building
## 2. Func<>, Expression<Func<>> (Lambda expressions), and expression tree basics
## 3. Manually building some example filter and field selection queries with Linq
## 4. Visualizing and exploring Lambda expression trees using LinqPad
## 5. Manually building Lambda expression trees for some example filter and field selection queries 
## 6. Designing the programmatic library interface and the Rest API to access the library
## 7. Parsing nested filter fields and filter operators
## 8. Generating Lambda expression trees for filter operators
## 9. Parsing nested field selections
## 10. Generating Lambda expression trees for field selections
## 11. Adding paging and support for logical deletes
