How to build a generic data querying library (efql) on top of Entity Framework Core, with similar functionality to GraphQL (including nested field/collection selection and nested filtering), but without implementing a GraphQL backend.

(Work in progress, soon will be adding a tutorial and the code)

## Func<>, Lambda expressions, and Lambda expression tree basics
## Manually building some example filter and field selection queries with Linq
## Visualizing Lambda expression trees using LinqPad
## Manually building Lambda expression trees for some example queries 
## Designing the programmatic library interface and the Rest API to access the library
## Parsing filter operators
## Generating Lambda expression trees for filter operators
## Parsing field selections
## Generating Lambda expression trees for field selections
